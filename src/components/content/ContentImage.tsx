/**
 * A content image lifted from the source Google Site and localized into
 * `public/Images/content/`.
 *
 * Callers pass the FILE NAME only. The directory and `assetPath()` are applied
 * here, in the one place that knows about them, for two reasons:
 *
 *  - a reference site cannot get the directory or its case wrong, and there is
 *    no prefix to keep in sync across a dozen call sites;
 *  - `scripts/check-drift.mjs` requires every `/Images/...` reference to be
 *    wrapped in `assetPath()` so GitHub Pages subpath deploys keep working.
 *    Passing a full path as a prop put a bare `src="/Images/..."` at each call
 *    site, which the guard reads as unwrapped even though this component does
 *    wrap it. Building the path here makes the guard's rule true rather than
 *    something to be excepted.
 *
 * Intrinsic dimensions are the source image's own naturalWidth/naturalHeight,
 * read from the live page at capture time — they are required by next/image and
 * keep the layout from shifting as each image loads.
