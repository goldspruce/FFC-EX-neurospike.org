/**
 * schema.org `NGO` JSON-LD for this charity.
 *
 * Every value that identifies the organization -- name, url, description,
 * email, logo, `taxID`, `sameAs` -- is read from src/lib/site.config.ts, and
 * each already appears on the site in human-readable form; nothing is
 * invented and nothing new has to be maintained.
 *
 * THREE VALUES ARE DECIDED HERE, NOT CONFIGURED: `@context`, `@type`
 * (see the NGO note below) and `nonprofitStatus`. They are schema-level
 * choices rather than site facts, and SiteConfig has no field for any of
 * them. If a fork is not a US 501(c)(3), `nonprofitStatus` is wrong for it
 * and must be changed here -- it will not follow from config.
 *
 * The point is to make facts the site already states machine-readable, so a
 * search engine or a charity aggregator can connect this site to the verified
 * nonprofit records rather than treating them as unrelated pages:
 *
 *  - `taxID` / `nonprofitStatus` are what donor-advised-fund tools and charity
 *    databases read to confirm 501(c)(3) status.
 *  - `sameAs` is the link that ties this domain to the GuideStar and Candid
 *    profiles. Without it those profiles and this site are, to a crawler,
 *    three unrelated things about an organization with a similar name.
 *
 * `NGO` rather than `ResearchOrganization`: both are defensible for an FRO,
 * and `NGO` is the type whose properties (`taxID`, `nonprofitStatus`) carry
 * the 501(c)(3) facts. If the charity would rather assert the research
 * identity, `ResearchOrganization` is a one-word change here -- see #24.
 *
 * OMITTED ON PURPOSE: `foundingDate` is not in config and is not published
 * anywhere on the site, so asserting one would be inventing a fact about the
 * organization. Add it to SiteConfig first if it should appear.
