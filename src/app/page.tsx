      <H2 id="fro">1. Focused Research Organization (FRO)</H2>
      <P>
        An FRO is a time-bound, technically ambitious effort designed to produce high-impact public
        goods that unblock scientific progress.

        A Focused Research Organization (FRO) is a time-limited (3 to 7 year), mission-driven,
        non-profit, or startup-structured entity designed to accelerate scientific progress by
        tackling, mid-scale, &ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo; projects. FROs bridge the gap between academia
        and industry by developing public-good tools, datasets, and infrastructures that are too
        large for labs and not profitable for companies.

      <H2 id="meta-question">2. Meta Question</H2>
      <P>
        Our FRO presents a unifying hypothesis for the biology of aging while simultaneously posing
        a structural meta-question regarding modern bioscience research. We propose Age-Related
        Fast-Spike Neuron Decline (FSND) as a rubric to formalize the study of a primary, systemic
        driver of functional decline as a distinct scientific field. By bootstrapping the science of
        FSND, we aim to determine how far a translation-ready framework can be developed entirely in
        silico, starting with a seminal review paper and a radically lean resource model.
      </P>
      <P>
        This meta-question rests on an underlying broader proposition— that computational biology
        will become &ldquo;the new biology&rdquo; in much the way that theoretical physics became
        &ldquo;the new physics&rdquo; about one century ago. Quantum physicists drove monumental
        progress through pure Gedankenexperiments (thought experiments) and mathematical modeling,
        thus making theoretical physics a real science and not mere abstract philosophy. By doing a
        deep dive into theory and math, a physicist could emerge with profound, structurally sound
        insights before eventually turning to experimental validation. If the true promise of
        computational biology is to be realized, modern biologists must demonstrate this same
        theoretical power, this time with in silico compute instead of paper and chalkboard.
