/**
 * The policy pages a site publishes as its OWN must be about that site's
 * organization, and must route enquiries to it.
 *
 * The template ships these documents pre-written with Free For Charity's
 * identity in the BODY text, not just in metadata, so a rebranded charity site
 * served a privacy policy naming a different organization as the data
 * controller, a Terms of Service governing someone else's services, and a
 * vulnerability disclosure policy scoped to someone else's domains. Nothing
 * caught it: `check:rebrand` reads config and a few known files, and the
 * metadata tests only read `title`/`description`.
 *
 * Assertions are written against `siteConfig`, never against a blacklist of the
 * template author's literals. The blacklist form looks equivalent and is not:
 * on Free For Charity's own deployment those literals are the CORRECT contact
 * details, so it fails the template while still passing a fork that merely
 * swapped in a different wrong address.
